Akt1	10090.ENSMUSP00000001780	thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1; AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine- protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis. This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported. AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GL [...]

Hspa1b	10090.ENSMUSP00000128525	heat shock protein 1B; In cooperation with other chaperones, Hsp70s stabilize preexistent proteins against aggregation and mediate the folding of newly translated polypeptides in the cytosol as well as within organelles. These chaperones participate in all these processes through their ability to recognize nonnative conformations of other proteins. They bind extended peptide segments with a net hydrophobic character exposed by polypeptides during translation and membrane translocation, or following stress-induced damage (By similarity)
Sugt1	10090.ENSMUSP00000052942	SGT1, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 (S. cerevisiae); May play a role in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins
Cdc37	10090.ENSMUSP00000019615	cell division cycle 37; Co-chaperone that binds to numerous kinases and promotes their interaction with the Hsp90 complex, resulting in stabilization and promotion of their activity
Catsper1	10090.ENSMUSP00000045430	cation channel, sperm associated 1; Voltage-gated calcium channel that plays a central role in sperm cell hyperactivation. Controls calcium entry to mediate the hyperactivated motility, a step needed for sperm motility which is essential late in the preparation of sperm for fertilization. Activated by intracellular alkalinization. Contrary to the human ortholog, not activated by progesterone
Nr3c1	10090.ENSMUSP00000025300	nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1; Receptor for glucocorticoids (GC). Has a dual mode of action: as a transcription factor that binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE), both for nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and as a modulator of other transcription factors. Affects inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. Could act as a coactivator for STAT5-dependent transcription upon growth hormone (GH) stimulation and could reveal an essential role of hepatic GR in the control of body growth. Involved in chromatin remodeling. Play [...] 
Hspa9	10090.ENSMUSP00000025217	heat shock protein 9; Implicated in the control of cell proliferation and cellular aging. May also act as a chaperone

Seems to control the nucleotide-dependent binding of mitochondrial HSP70 to substrate proteins. Stimulates ATPase activity of mt-HSP70. May also serve to modulate the interconversion of oligomeric (inactive) and monomeric (active) forms of mt-HSP70

Co-chaperone of HSPA8/HSC70, it stimulates its ATPase activity. May inhibit both the autophosphorylation of EIF2AK2/PKR and the ability of EIF2AK2 to catalyze phosphorylation of the EIF2A. May inhibit EIF2AK3/PERK activity
