Eif4a2	10090.ENSMUSP00000023599	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A2; ATP-dependent RNA helicase which is a subunit of the eIF4F complex involved in cap recognition and is required for mRNA binding to ribosome. In the current model of translation initiation, eIF4A unwinds RNA secondary structures in the 5'-UTR of mRNAs which is necessary to allow efficient binding of the small ribosomal subunit, and subsequent scanning for the initiator codon
Eif4e3	10090.ENSMUSP00000032151	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E member 3; Recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis. May act as an inhibitor of EIF4E1 activity
Pabpc1	10090.ENSMUSP00000001809	poly(A) binding protein, cytoplasmic 1; Binds the poly(A) tail of mRNA. May be involved in cytoplasmic regulatory processes of mRNA metabolism such as pre- mRNA splicing. Its function in translational initiation regulation can either be enhanced by PAIP1 or repressed by PAIP2. Can probably bind to cytoplasmic RNA sequences other than poly(A) in vivo. Involved in translationally coupled mRNA turnover. Implicated with other RNA-binding proteins in the cytoplasmic deadenylation/translational and decay interplay of the FOS mRNA mediated by the major coding-region determinant of instability [...] 
Eif4g3	10090.ENSMUSP00000081232	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 3; Probable component of the protein complex eIF4F, which is involved in the recognition of the mRNA cap, ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure and recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome. Thought to be a functional homolog of EIF4G1 (By similarity)
Eif4e	10090.ENSMUSP00000029803	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; Recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of the mRNAs secondary structures. May play an important role in spermatogenesis through translational regulation of stage- specific mRNAs during germ cell development (By similarity). Its translation stimulation activity is repressed by binding to the complex CYFIP1-FMR1. Component of the CYFIP1-EIF4E-FMR1 complex which binds to the mRNA cap and mediates transla [...] 
Eif4e1b	10090.ENSMUSP00000105630	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 1B; Recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of the mRNAs secondary structures (By similarity)
Eif4e2	10090.ENSMUSP00000108859	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E member 2; Recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of the mRNAs secondary structures
Eif4a1	10090.ENSMUSP00000127034	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1; ATP-dependent RNA helicase which is a subunit of the eIF4F complex involved in cap recognition and is required for mRNA binding to ribosome. In the current model of translation initiation, eIF4A unwinds RNA secondary structures in the 5'-UTR of mRNAs which is necessary to allow efficient binding of the small ribosomal subunit, and subsequent scanning for the initiator codon
Ncbp1	10090.ENSMUSP00000030014	nuclear cap binding protein subunit 1; Component of the cap-binding complex (CBC), which binds cotranscriptionally to the 5'-cap of pre-mRNAs and is involved in various processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, translation regulation, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, RNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) by microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNA export. The CBC complex is involved in mRNA export from the nucleus via its interaction with ALYREF/THOC4/ALY, leading to the recruitment of the mRNA export machinery to the 5'-end of mRNA and to mRNA export in a 5' to 3' direction through the nuclear pore. The CBC  [...] 
Eif4g1	10090.ENSMUSP00000047678	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4, gamma 1; Component of the protein complex eIF4F, which is involved in the recognition of the mRNA cap, ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure and recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome (By similarity)
Eif4g2	10090.ENSMUSP00000124551	eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4, gamma 2; Appears to play a role in the switch from cap-dependent to IRES-mediated translation during mitosis, apoptosis and viral infection. Cleaved by some caspases and viral proteases
